                      Kyiv (or Kiev), Ukraine's capital, is a large city located on
                      the shores of the Dnipro river. Of course, no one in their right
                      mind would swim in the river, unless they grew up here, in which
                      case they've probably tried it at some point. Summers are hot
                      here, and the winters are drafty, but the fall and the spring
                      are are absolutely amazing.
                    </p>
                    <p class="place__paragraph">
                      The city itself is a mix of pre-revolution, post-war and soviet
                      architecture, all of it sprinkled with modified balconies. If
                      you're on the right bank of the Dnipro, the landscape is
                      difficult to traverse for people on bikes and those wearing
                      heels. The left bank is considered far less interesting and
                      prestigious though, even by people who live on the far outskirts
                      of the right one.

                      The medieval ruin of Cricieth Castle overlooks the town below
                      from a rock that juts out into the sea. It is thought to have
                      been built by Llewelyn the Great in the 13th century. Some 900
                      years later, the self-styled Pearl of Wales on the Shores of
                      Snowdonia has become a popular tourist destination during the
                      summer months.

                      A short walk down the road from the castle, you can enjoy the
                      world's best ice cream at Cadwalader's, whose secret ingredient
                      is rumored to be locally sourced seaweed. Another claim to fame
                      is the fact that Cricieth won the Wales in Bloom award for five
                      years in a row for its spectacular floral displays around town.
                      It was also home to David Lloyd George, the only Welshman ever
                      to hold the office of Prime Minister of the UK.

                      The town is surrounded by beautiful forests and countryside.
                      It's known as the arts and crafts capital of the state, and
                      visitors will find plenty of shopping opportunities: shops with
                      handmade jewelry, candles, wood items, galleries, glass studios,
                      and more. The town holds an annual festival celebrating
                      "spoonbread", a local dish made with cornbread and served with a
                      wooden spoon.

                      However, it's probably known best for the local college. Berea
                      College was founded in 1855 and was the first college in the
                      south to be racially integrated, as well as the first to be
                      coeducational. Somewhat uniquely, it charges no tuition — every
                      student receives a full-tuition scholarship.

                      Muramvya is one of the 18 provinces of Burundi. In the kingdom
                      era, Muramvya was the royal capital and in 2007, because of its
                      cultural and natural landscape, it was added to the UNESCO World

                      sea level, Mount Teza is one of the coldest places in the
                      province. But that cool breeze allows for one of the largest
                      plantations of tea and coffee in the country, which make up the
